From the two visualizations, we can draw the following inferences:

### 1. **Crime Map (crimes_inc):**
   - This map shows the total number of cognizable crimes reported across various states in India.
   - States like **Maharashtra (184,596 crimes)**, **Tamil Nadu (168,791 crimes)**, **Uttar Pradesh (181,103 crimes)**, and **West Bengal (107,245 crimes)** show higher crime incidences compared to the northeastern states and neighboring countries (like Bhutan and Bangladesh), which have significantly lower crime rates.
   - States in **south-central India** and the **northern parts** (e.g., Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand) show moderate crime rates.
   - The data suggests that **densely populated** and **more urbanized states** tend to have higher crime numbers.

### 2. **Burglary Report (burgelaryReport):**
   - This bar chart represents the **incidence of burglaries** in different categories of administrative regions: **Cities, States, and Union Territories (UTs)**.
   - **States** have by far the highest number of burglary incidents (**123,454 cases**), which dwarfs the number reported in **Cities (11,166 cases)** and **Union Territories (2,012 cases)**.
   - This implies that burglaries are far more common in **states**, possibly due to the larger population size and more extensive geographic areas compared to cities and UTs.

### Combined Inference:
   - **States** tend to have both higher overall crime and higher burglary rates, indicating that crime is concentrated in larger, more populous regions.
   - **Cities** show a significant but smaller contribution to the crime numbers, suggesting that while urban areas contribute to crime, the issue is more widespread across larger state territories.
